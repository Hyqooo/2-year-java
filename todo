TODO:
  - I need to design algorithm of position calculations with more care
  - Render update think about it maybe it doesn't work
  - Proper mapping from real sizes to pixels
  - Think better scaling functions
  - Think about if allow to user to freely scale or just show different fixed scales(all solar system/four planets)
  - Think how to easily turn off thing to render(Maybe with boolean value that signals if a body should be rendered or not)
  - Think one more time about relative sizes and how do this easy to do and change them


UNIMPORTANT:
  - Think up good visual design (Unimportant)
    - Bound both visual and control panels
  - Better algorithm for render update (super-unimportant)
