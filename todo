TODO:
  - Now size scale works only with central scaling maybe if I can, I'll add scaling at any point
  	- Maybe even attaching to any skybody
  - There's a problem when we change slider values - system moves back and forth a little

UNIMPORTANT:
  - Think up good visual design (Unimportant)
    - Bound both visual and control panels

DONE:
	  - Think about if allow to user to freely scale or just show different fixed scales(all solar system/four planets)
	  - I need to design algorithm of position calculations with more care
	  - Think better scaling functions
	  - Proper mapping from real sizes to pixels
	  - Think one more time about relative sizes and how do this easy to do and change them
	  - Think how to easily turn off thing to render(Maybe with boolean value that signals if a body should be rendered or not)
  - Think up something for easy scaling time and size
  - BUG: orbit scale doesn't work properly
  - Render update think about it maybe it doesn't work
  - put all planets into arraylist and just iterate thorugh them
  - Fixes with milliseconds it is not how it should work(Fixing of the time)
  - Better algorithm for render update (super-unimportant)
  - Draw not circumferences but circles  
  - Add color to the orbit
  - Add color to the skybody
